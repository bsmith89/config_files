A set of config files for linux systems

I want to be able to quickly place them on any system and expect all
of my default settings to just work.  Currently supported tools:

Login shells
    .profile
Bourne again shell (bash)
    .bashrc
    .bash_aliases
Vi Modified (vim)
    .vimrc
GNU Screen (screen)
    .screenrc
